<h2> What is Thanksgiving?</h2>

<p> Thanksgiving is a U.S. federal holiday on the fourth Thursday of November, rooted in a 1621 harvest feast shared by Plymouth colonists (Pilgrims) and the Wampanoag people, celebrated as a time to give thanks for blessings, family, and bounty, though it's now largely secular, marked by large meals, traditions like turkey and pie, and community giving, with evolving historical perspectives including Native American viewpoints. </p>
